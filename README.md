Notes for learning and applying R to questions about crime and the justice system

Best viewed at the [R4crim github.io site](https://gregridgeway.github.io/R4crim/)

These notes form the basis of Penn Criminology's Criminal Justice Data Science course that I have taught since 2014. Students code in R to answer questions like 

-  What happens to crime when big movies come out?
-  Where are Chicago's crime hotspots?
-  Which crimes happen inside LA's gang injunction areas?
-  If the police shoot someone, do they tranfer them to the nearest hospital?

On the way to answering these questions students learn about 

-  regular expressions
-  SQL
-  web scraping
-  parallel processing
-  geographic data
-  official data sources (NIBRS, NCVS, ACS), and
-  a variety of data and coding skills
