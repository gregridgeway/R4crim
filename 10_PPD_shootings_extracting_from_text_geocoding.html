<p>In this section, we are going to explore officer-involved shootings (OIS) in Philadelphia. The Philadelphia Police Department posts a lot of information about officer-involved shootings online going back to 2016. Have a look at their <a href="https://www.phillypolice.com/ois/">OIS webpage</a>. While a lot of information has been posted to the webpage, more information is buried in text linked to each of the incidents. In order for us to explore these data, we are going to scrape the basic information from the webpage, have R dig into the text for dates, clean up addresses using regular expressions, geocode the addresses to latitude/longitude with the ArcGIS geocoder (using JSON), and then make maps describing the shootings.</p>
<p>Start by loading the packages we will need.</p>

<p>Buried in the HTML code are the entries in the table. Even though all the information does not appear on the main webpage, it is in the HTML. This is not always the case. Some pages dynamically generate information as the user interacts with a page and the page elements. We are going to use this as an opportunity to learn more advanced webscraping methods.</p>
<p>Instead of using <code>scan()</code>, we are going to use the <code>chromote</code> package to open a hidden Chrome browser that we can control remotely from R. For this to work you do need to have a <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome browser</a> installed on your computer. From R, we can simulate user actions, like typing a URL in the address bar, selecting elements on the page, and clicking buttons.</p>
<p>The <em>page source</em> is the static HTML the browser receives from the server (e.g.&nbsp;what <code>scan()</code> would capture). The <em>Document Object Model</em> (DOM) is the live, in-memory object the browser constructs from that source and then updates as JavaScript runs. When we interact with a webpage, like clicking, we are interacting with the DOM.</p>
<p>Start by initiating a new hidden Chrome browser.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>b <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> ChromoteSession<span class="sc">$</span><span class="fu">new</span>()</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Nothing will be visible on your screen at this point. If you want to watch the browser is doing in response to R actions, you can use <code>view()</code>, but this is not necessary.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>b<span class="sc">$</span><span class="fu">view</span>()</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Let’s tell our hidden browser to navigate over to the PPD OIS webpage. Sometimes pages take a moment to load. go_to() waits for the navigation to the page finish before completing.</p>

<p>Let’s take a little cybersecurity detour for a moment. If you right-click on a webpage and select “Inspect,” then you can see the DOM for the page. After inspection, I noticed that the OIS table’s ID is <code>#data-table-ois</code>. I can tell the DOM to change elements on the page. To demonstrate, I will change the address in the 25th row to 3718 Locust Walk. <code>tr:nth-child(25)</code> selects the 25th row and <code>td:nth-child(2)</code> selects the column. Setting <code>.textContent = '3718 Locust Walk'</code> changes the cell text in the DOM immediately.</p>

<p>This is how the “refund/overpayment scam” works. A fraudster gets the victim to view their account webpage and to give the fraudster some level of remote control. The fraudster then manipulates the DOM to give the impression that they have mistakenly sent the victim $10,000 instead of $1,000. The fraudster then convince the victim to send the $9,000 difference even though no money was ever given to them.</p>
<p>Rather than try to scam someone, let’s get back to the business of pulling all the OIS data into R. I will first get the ID of the main HTML from DOM. Then I will read in the HTML associated with that ID.</p>

<p>Looks like we got all 25 of the OIS incidents from the first page. Note that it still has our manipulated address for the 25th OIS incident. Shortly we will refresh the webpage to scrape all of the incidents and that will reset the addresses to their original values. On the PPD’s page, each OIS’s ID has a hyperlink that gets us more detailed information about each incident. Extract those URLs by looking for elements in the table body with an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> HTML tag. Eventually we will store these URLs so that we can scrape them for the OIS details.</p>

<p>With that, we have been able to get all of the information for the first 25 OIS incidents. Now we have to “click” the Next button to get to the next set of 25 OIS incidents. First, I will check to see if it is disabled. Since we are still looking at the first page it will not be disabled, but when we are looking at the final page of OIS incidents then it will be disabled. To figure out the name of that Next button, in my browser I right-clicked on the button, selected Inspect, and then reviewed the resulting HTML code.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb28"><pre class="sourceCode html code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode html"><span id="cb28-1"><a href="#cb28-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dt">&lt;</span><span class="kw">a</span><span class="ot"> class</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="st">"paginate_button next"</span><span class="ot"> aria-controls</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="st">"data-table-ois"</span><span class="ot"> role</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="st">"link"</span><span class="ot"> data-dt-idx</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="st">"next"</span><span class="ot"> tabindex</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="st">"0"</span><span class="ot"> id</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="st">"data-table-ois_next"</span><span class="dt">&gt;</span>Next<span class="dt">&lt;/</span><span class="kw">a</span><span class="dt">&gt;</span></span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
<p>I see that the HTML tag is <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> and its classes are <code>paginate</code> and <code>next</code>. So <code>a.paginate.next</code> will search the HTML code for an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element with both a <code>paginate</code> and <code>next</code> class.</p>

<p>On a single page there might be several such buttons. A more robust method of finding the right button is to query it by name, in this case <code>data-table-ois_next</code>.</p>

<p>Armed with all the skills to navigate and extract key information from this site, we can wrap these ideas in a <code>while()</code> loop that will keep scraping OIS data as long as the Next button is active.</p>

<p>Now let’s dig into the details of the incident, starting with the first OIS. The hyperlink in the very first OIS incident points to the page <a href="https://www.phillypolice.com/ois/25-14/">https://www.phillypolice.com/ois/25-14/</a>. Let’s read in the incident details from that page. In your browser, if you right-click and Inspect the text description of the incident, then you will find that the text has the id <code>ois-content-area</code>. We can grab that by name.</p>

<pre><code>[1] "On June 20th, 2025, at approximately 10:41 a.m., Officer A*, equipped with an Animal Control Pole, responded to a radio call in the 2600 block of South 21st Street, in reference to a dog bite victim. Note: Officers initially responded to a dog bite incident, which occurred on the 2100 block of Shunk Street, where a 59-year-old victim, had been attacked by two brown pit bull dogs while walking on the 2100 block of Shunk Street. The victim sustained multiple injuries, including bite marks on her left cheek and chin, and was bleeding from the face. The victim was transported to Presbyterian Hospital in stable condition by Philadelphia Fire Department paramedics. Upon Officer A’s arrival in the area of South 21st Street, the same two brown pit bull dogs were observed walking south on 21st Street toward Oregon Avenue. At that time, Officers #1 and #2 were attempting to control one of the dogs with an Animal Control Pole. The dogs then began chasing Officer #1 into the street, with one appearing to bite his hand. Officers #1 and #2 both drew their service weapons and discharged multiple rounds at the dogs, striking both. The injured dogs fled and collapsed in a nearby parking lot. One of the dogs died at the scene; the other was secured and transported to ACCT Philly for treatment. Note: Officer A was present at the time of the officer-involved shooting but did not discharge their firearm Officer #1 is 34-years-old and a 2-year veteran of the Philadelphia Police Department Officer #2 is also 34-years-old and is a 5-year veteran of the Philadelphia Police Department. Both officers are assigned to the 17th Police District. As is standard procedure in all officer-involved shootings, both officers have been placed on administrative duty pending the outcome of investigations by the Internal Affairs Bureau, the Officer Involved Shooting Investigation Unit, and the District Attorney’s Office."</code></pre>

<p>While the main OIS webpage did not give the date of the incident, the text details always show the date. We can extract those dates with regular expressions. The dates may come in a variety of formats, but we can use the <code>lubridate</code> package to parse them. Let’s start with those where the date is spelled out.</p>

<section id="geocoding-the-ois-locations" class="level1" data-number="5">
<h1 data-number="5"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Geocoding the OIS locations</h1>
<p>Our OIS data frame has the address for every incident, but to be more useful we really need the geographic coordinates. If we had the coordinates, then we could put them on a map, tabulate how many incident occur within an area, calculate distances, and answer questions about the geography of these data.</p>
<p>Geocoding is the process of converting a text description of a location (typically an address or intersection) to obtain geographic coordinates (often longitude/latitude, but other coordinate systems are also possible). Google Maps currently reigns supreme in this area. Google Maps understand very general descriptions of locations. You can ask for the coordinates of something like “chipotle near UPenn” and it will understand that “UPenn” means the University of Pennsylvania and that “chipotle” is the burrito chain. Unfortunately, as of June 2018 Google Maps requires a credit card in order to access its geocoding service. Previously, anyone could geocode up to 2,500 locations per day without needing to register.</p>
<p>We will use the the ArcGIS geocoder to get the coordinates of every location. Many web data sources use a standardized language for providing data. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is quite common and ArcGIS uses JSON.</p>
<p>The URL for ArcGIS has the form <code>https://geocode.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/World/GeocodeServer/findAddressCandidates?f=json&amp;singleLine=38th%20and%20Walnut,%20Philadelphia,%20PA&amp;outFields=Match_addr,Addr_type</code></p>
<p>You can see the address for Penn’s McNeil Building embedded in this URL. Spaces need to be replaced with <code>%20</code> (the space character has ASCII code 20). Let’s see what data we get back from this URL.</p>

<p>It is messy, but readable. You can see embedded in this text the <code>lat</code> and <code>lon</code> for this address. You can also see that it should not be too hard for a machine to extract these coordinates, and the rest of the information here, from this block of text. This is the point of JSON, producing data in a format that a human could understand in a small batch, but a machine could process fast and easily.</p>
<p>The <code>jsonlite</code> R package facilitates the conversion of JSON text like this into convenient R objects.</p>

<p>To make geocoding a little more convenient, here is an R function that automates the process of taking an address, filling in special characters (like spaces) with their ASCII codes with <code>URLencode()</code>, and retrieving the JSON results from the ArcGIS geocoding service.</p>

<p>ArcGIS geocoding result for 3718 Locust Walk</p>

<p><code>leaflet()</code> prepares the mapping process. <code>addTiles()</code> pulls in the relevant map image (buildings and streets). <code>setView()</code> takes the longitude and latitude from our <code>gcPenn</code> object, sets that as the center of the map, and zooms in to level “18,” which is a fairly close zoom of about one block. <code>addCircleMarkers()</code> creates a circle at the selected point.</p>
<p>We are almost ready to throw all of our addresses at the geocoder, but let’s first make sure the addresses look okay. Several locations have <code>&amp;</code> where the ArcGIS geocoder wants <code>and</code>.</p>

<p>Many addresses just give the block, like “3700 block of Locust Walk.” We will need to change these to the midpoint of the block like “3750 Locust Walk” so that we get a geocoding hit that is nearby.</p>

Upon entering the front door, the officer observed the living room television missing, the rear kitchen window open, and the rear kitchen door ajar. The officer heard voices coming from the basement. The officer went to the top of the basement steps and announced, “Police.” A male appeared at the bottom of the steps and charged up the steps toward the officer with a dark metal object in his hand. In response, the officer discharged his weapon one time missing the offender. The offender fell down the steps crashing into the basement wall. The offender along with a second offender that was also in the basement fled out the rear basement door with the officer in foot pursuit. Upon exiting the rear basement door, the officer observed a green/blue van pull away from his property. The officer apprehended one offender in the 3200 block of Wellington Street. An off-duty detective apprehended the other offender near Brighton and Hawthorne Streets. There were no reported injuries as a result of this police firearm discharge. No weapon was recovered. *** Information posted in the original summary reflects a preliminary understanding of what occurred at the time of the incident.

1 OIS# 17-08 (March 29, 2017) On Wednesday, March 29, 2017, at approximately 5:39 PM, two uniformed officers in a marked vehicle responded to a radio assignment of “Person with a gun” at 5600 Whitby Avenue. A description of the individual was broadcast. Upon arrival at the location both officers observed a male who met the description entering the driver’s seat of a parked minivan. As the male approached the open driver’s door area both officers instructed him to stop. The male instead sat in the driver seat. The male accelerated the vehicle rearward striking officer number one, knocking him to the ground. The officer got back on his feet observed the male driver reach under the driver’s seat (through the open drivers side door), and officer number one discharged one round at the male. The male drove from the location, struck a vehicle at 5700 Woodland Avenue, and continued toward Island Avenue and Lindbergh Boulevard where the minivan became disabled. The male exited the minivan, entered an unoccupied vehicle that was nearby with the engine running and the keys in the ignition. He ushered five passengers from the minivan into the stolen vehicle. The male drove the stolen vehicle to a house in New Castle Delaware, and dropped off four of the passengers. The male and a remaining female passenger drove to a second house in New Castle Delaware in the stolen vehicle. New Castle County Police Officers responded to the second location and report to Philadelphia Police that New Castle County Police Officers attempted to arrest the male who was inside the stolen vehicle. A uniformed New Castle County officer discharged his firearm multiple times, striking the male. The male was pronounced deceased at Christiana Hospital. There were no other injuries as a result of this incident. No firearm was recovered from the male or the vehicles. The female was not charged with any offense. *** Information posted in the original summary reflects a preliminary understanding of what occurred at the time of the incident. This information is posted shortly after the incident and may be updated as the investigation leads to new information. The DA’s Office is provided all the information from the PPD’s investigation prior to their charging decision.
2                              PS#16-30 9/16/16 On Friday, September 16, 2016, at approximately 11:18 P.M., a uniformed sergeant in a marked police vehicle was seated in her parked vehicle in the 5100 block of Sansom Street, when a male approached and without warning, began to discharge a firearm, striking the sergeant, as she remained seated in her vehicle. The offender then began walking east on Sansom Street, stopping at a lounge/bar in the 5100 block of Sansom Street, where he discharged his firearm into the lounge/bar, striking a female employee and a male security guard. The offender continued walking east on Sansom Street to the 4900 block, where he discharged his firearm into an occupied parked vehicle, striking one female and one male occupant. Responding uniformed officers, in marked police vehicles, along with an officer from the University of Pennsylvania police force, located the offender in an alleyway in the rear of the 4800 blocks of Sansom and Walnut Streets. While in the 4800 block of Sansom Street the offender discharged his firearm, striking the University of Pennsylvania Officer as well as a marked police vehicle. Four Officers (one of whom was the University of Pennsylvania Officer) discharged their firearms, striking the offender. The offender fell to the ground and dropped his firearm. Fire Rescue responded and pronounced the offender deceased. The offender’s firearm, a 9MM, semi-automatic pistol, with an obliterated serial number, loaded with 14 live rounds, was recovered at the scene. There were three empty magazines from the offender’s firearm recovered throughout the scene. The sergeant, the University of Pennsylvania Officer, along with the four civilians who were all struck by gunfire, were transported to Penn-Presbyterian Hospital for treatment. The female from the parked vehicle was later pronounced deceased at Penn-Presbyterian Hospital. *** Information posted in the original summary reflects a preliminary understanding of what occurred at the time of the incident.

Park Avenue. The officer observed that one of the males was armed with a handgun. The officer, who was armed, identified himself as a police officer and ordered the offender to drop his gun. The offender turned toward the officer and pointed the firearm at him. In response, the officer discharged his weapon at the offender. The offender fled to a rear parking lot in the 5700 block of N. Broad Street, where he fell to the ground, dropping his weapon. The offender retrieved his weapon and again pointed it at the officer. The officer responded by discharging his weapon, striking the offender. The offender again fled but collapsed near the corner of Broad and Chew Streets, where he was arrested. The offenders’ firearm, a .22 caliber revolver, loaded with three spent casings, was recovered at the scene. The offender was transported to Albert Einstein Medical Center, where he was later pronounced deceased as a result of his injuries. There were no other reported injuries as a result of this incident. *** Information posted in the original summary reflects a preliminary understanding of what occurred at the time of the incident.

<p>Reading the details of the incidents, we can come up with reasonable fixes to the addresses. OIS 17-08 is not a PPD shooting incident. Some PPD officers were present when New Castle County (Delaware) police officers shot someone. Let’s drop this incident. The remaining incidents we can edit based on the contents of the OIS description. We will also tack on “, Philadelphia, PA” to the end of each location to improve geocoding accuracy.</p>

<p>Let’s test out the process for just the first location. The code here shows how you can extract each bit of information that we want from geocoding an address: the coordinates (long,lat), the specific address that the geocoding service translated our requested address to, a quality-of-match score, and location type (e.g.&nbsp;StreetInt, PointAddress, StreetAddress).</p>

<p>With that we are ready to run all of our addresses through the ArcGIS geocoder. We could have geocoded all these addresses with the more simple code <code>lapply(ois$location, geocodeARCGIS)</code>. However, if the JSON connection to the geocoder fails for even one of the addresses (likely if you have a poor internet connection), then the whole <code>lapply()</code> function fails. With the for-loop implementation, if the connection fails, then <code>ois</code> still keeps all of the prior geocoding results and you can restart the for-loop at the point where it failed.</p>

<p>All the points have latitude around 39 and 40 and longitude around -75. That is a good sign!</p>
<p>Let’s check the “address type”. We should worry about addresses geocode to a “StreetName.” That means the incident got geocoded to, say, “Market Street” but we are not sure where along Market Street the incident actually occurred. The geocoder most likely placed the incident at the midpoint of the street.</p>

<p>OIS 21-14 has address “3800 Landsowne Drive”. Presumably it intended to find 3800 Lansdowne Drive, but it could not place the 3800 block on Lansdowne Drive. The text describes the incident as occurring behind a school. Let’s zoom in and see where this might have occurred. It must have occurred behind the School of the Future. I used Google Maps to find the coordinates behind this school.</p>

When officers attempted a pedestrian stop, the offender fled on foot, running westbound on Somerset Street. Officer #1 pursued on foot while Officer #2 followed in the patrol vehicle. The officers caught up to the offender at the intersection of Mutter and Somerset Streets, where a struggle ensued. Officers #1 and #2 tackled the offender to the ground, attempting to prevent him from accessing a handgun in his bag. During the struggle, the offender was in the process of pulling out a Privately Manufactured Firearm (P-80 9MM) from the bag and discharged it, firing through the bag.* Both officers discharged their firearms, striking the offender in the chest area. The offender dropped the weapon and the black bag. The officers immediately transported the offender to Temple Hospital, where he was pronounced deceased at 6:55 PM. Both officers sustained scrapes to their knees, which did not require medical attention. The officers’ Body Worn Cameras (BWCs) were activated and captured portions of the incident, though they were knocked off during the struggle.

Upon arrival, officers learned that prior to their arrival, two dogs had attacked a 36-year-old Black female and her small dog. The woman was able to seek refuge inside her vehicle. Police were able to secure one of the dogs in a police car. As the female victim exited her vehicle, unaware that the second dog, a female pit bull, was still at large, the pit bull attacked her and her dog again. A police sergeant on the scene discharged his firearm multiple times, striking the female pit bull. The dog then fled east on Ogden Street to the 800 block of North Palm Street, approximately half a block away. Police transported the injured dog to Penn Animal Hospital.

Upon arriving at the rear driveway of Friends Hospital, Officer A opened the transport wagon’s rear doors. Officer A explained the process of self-committal to male, who became upset and quickly became agitated. Without warning, the male rushed toward Officer A, knocking him to the ground. A physical altercation ensued between the male and both officers. The male attempted to grab Officer A’s Taser, and then Officer A’s firearm. Officer #1 deployed his Taser, which was ineffective. At this point, the male gained control of Officer A’s gun and both officers separated from the male. Officer #1 discharged his firearm, striking the male. The male then discharged the firearm toward Officer #1, missing him. During the incident, Officer A was struck in his ballistic vest. After a preliminary investigation by the PPD Firearms Identification Unit (FIU), and based on the evidence available, it is believed Officer A’s vest was struck by a projectile fired from Officer #1’s weapon. The male was transported to Albert Einstein Medical Center and pronounced dead at 1:07 p.m. Both officers were transported to Temple University Hospital for treatment and released. Video footage from Friends Hospital depicted the incident. Officer A activated his body-worn camera during the ground struggle. The investigation into this incident is ongoing.

The inspector was accompanied by sheriff’s deputies from the Philadelphia Sheriff’s Department. After knocking and announcing their presence, a Black male, later identified as the offender, walked to the door holding what appeared to be a rifle or long gun.

<h1 data-number="6"><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Working with shapefiles and coordinate systems</h1>
<p>The Philadelphia Police Department divides the city into Police Service Areas (PSAs). The city provides a <em>shapefile</em>, a file containing geographic data, that describes the boundaries of the PSAs at Philadelphia’s <a href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/police-service-areas">open data site</a>. R can read these files using the <code>st_read()</code> function provided in the <code>sf</code> (simple features) package. Even though <code>st_read()</code> appears to only be accessing <code>Boundaries_PSA.shp</code>, you should have all of the <code>Boundaries_PSA</code> files in your <code>10_shapefiles_and_data</code> folder. The other files have information that <code>st_read()</code> needs, like the coordinate system stored in <code>Boundaries_PSA.prj</code>. If you do not have all <code>Boundaries_PSA</code> files in your folder, then in a few lines you will get errors like “the sfc object should have crs set,” meaning that the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) is missing.</p>

<p>The coordinate system used to describe the PPD boundaries is the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) maintained by the United States National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, one of several standards to aid in navigation and geography. The European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG) maintains a catalog of different coordinate systems (should be no surprise that oil exploration has driven the development of high quality geolocation standards). They have assigned the standard longitude/latitude coordinate system to be [EPSG4326]((http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4326/). You can find the full collection of coordinate systems at <a href="http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/">spatialreference.org</a>. You can see in the output above a reference to EPSG 4326.</p>
<p>Many of us are comfortable with the longitude/latitude angular coordinate systems. However, the distance covered by a degree of longitude shrinks as you move towards the poles and only equals the distance covered by a degree of latitude at the equator. In addition, the earth is not very spherical so the coordinate system used for computing distances on the earth surface might need to depend on where you are on the earth surface.</p>
<p>Almost all web mapping tools (Google Maps, ESRI, OpenStreetMaps) use the pseudo-Mercator projection (<a href="http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/3857/">EPSG3857</a>). Let’s convert our PPD map to that coordinate system.</p>

<p>The CRS now indicates that this is a Mercator projection with distance measured in meters (<code>LENGTHUNIT["metre",1]</code>). There are special coordinate systems for every part of the world.

<p>This coordinate system is the Lambert Conic Conformal (LCC). This particular projection of the <code>PPDmap</code> is tuned to provide good precision for the southern part of Pennsylvania (note the parallel coordinates are at the latitude of southern Pennsylvania and the meridian is a little west of Philadelphia) and distances are measured in feet (note the <code>LENGTHUNIT["US survey foot",0.304800609601219]</code> tag in the CRS description).</p>
<p>Let’s transform back to longitude/latitude. It really is best to work using a different coordinate system, but I’m going to stick with longitude/latitude so that the values make a little more sense to us.</p>

<p>To make the dots a little transparent, I have used the <code>rgb()</code> function with which you can mix red, green, and blue colors and set the transparency. The <code>1</code> tells <code>rgb()</code> to use maximum red. The two <code>0</code>s tell <code>rgb()</code> to use no green or blue. The 0.5 tells <code>rgb()</code> to make the dots halfway transparent.</p>

<p>Spatial joins is the process of linking two data sources by their geography. For the case of the OIS data, we want to know how many OISs occurred in each PSA. To do this we need to drop each OIS point location into the PSA polygons and have R tell us in which polygon did each OIS land.</p>
<p>First we need to convert our <code>ois</code> data frame to an <code>sf</code> object, communicating to R that the <code>lon</code> and <code>lat</code> columns are special. At this stage we also have to communicate in what coordinate system are the <code>lon</code> and <code>lat</code> values. <code>st_as_sf()</code> converts an R object into an <code>sf</code> object.</p>

1 PS#16-30 9/16/16 On Friday, September 16, 2016, at approximately 11:18 P.M., a uniformed sergeant in a marked police vehicle was seated in her parked vehicle in the 5100 block of Sansom Street, when a male approached and without warning, began to discharge a firearm, striking the sergeant, as she remained seated in her vehicle. The offender then began walking east on Sansom Street, stopping at a lounge/bar in the 5100 block of Sansom Street, where he discharged his firearm into the lounge/bar, striking a female employee and a male security guard. The offender continued walking east on Sansom Street to the 4900 block, where he discharged his firearm into an occupied parked vehicle, striking one female and one male occupant. Responding uniformed officers, in marked police vehicles, along with an officer from the University of Pennsylvania police force, located the offender in an alleyway in the rear of the 4800 blocks of Sansom and Walnut Streets. While in the 4800 block of Sansom Street the offender discharged his firearm, striking the University of Pennsylvania Officer as well as a marked police vehicle. Four Officers (one of whom was the University of Pennsylvania Officer) discharged their firearms, striking the offender. The offender fell to the ground and dropped his firearm. Fire Rescue responded and pronounced the offender deceased. The offender’s firearm, a 9MM, semi-automatic pistol, with an obliterated serial number, loaded with 14 live rounds, was recovered at the scene. There were three empty magazines from the offender’s firearm recovered throughout the scene. The sergeant, the University of Pennsylvania Officer, along with the four civilians who were all struck by gunfire, were transported to Penn-Presbyterian Hospital for treatment. The female from the parked vehicle was later pronounced deceased at Penn-Presbyterian Hospital. *** Information posted in the original summary reflects a preliminary understanding of what occurred at the time of the incident. This information is posted shortly after the incident and may be updated as the investigation leads to new information. The DA’s Office is provided all the information from the PPD’s investigation prior to their charging decision.</code></pre>

The first two digits correspond to red, digits three and four correspond to green, digits five and six correspond to blue, and the last two digits correspond to transparency. These are hexadecimal numbers (base 16). Hexadecimal numbers use the digits 0-9, like normal decimal system numbers, and then denote 10 as A, 11 as B, on up to 15 as F. So FF as a decimal is <span class="math inline">\(15 \times 16 + 15 = 255\)</span>, which is the maximum value for a two digit hexadecimal. The hexadecimal 80 as a decimal is <span class="math inline">\(8 \times 16 + 0 = 128\)</span>, which is in the middle of the range 0 to 255. So the first color code, FFFF80FF, means maximum red, maximum green, half blue, and not transparent at all. This mixture is known more commonly as “yellow”.</p>
<p>Now we join <code>PPDmap</code> with our color lookup table in <code>a</code> and plot it.</p>

<p>Those PSAs with the least shootings are a very pale yellow. As we examine PSAs with a greater number of OISs, their colors get redder and redder.</p>
<p><code>sf</code> objects have their own default plotting method to accomplish these kind of “heat maps.” The default palette is generated with <code>sf.colors()</code>.</p>

<h1 data-number="7"><span class="header-section-number">7</span> Summary</h1>
<p>We started with just a web page linking to a collection of text descriptions. We used a variety of webscraping and regular expressions to extract everything we could from the web page tables. We had R “read” the text descriptions to extract the dates. We geocoded the stops so that we could put them on a map. Finally, we tabulated by PSA the number of OISs and mapped those as well.</p>
<p>If you have worked through all of this, then I would recommend that you save your objects, using <code>save(ois, PSAlookup, file="PPDOIS.RData")</code>. That way you will not have to scrape everything off the web again or redo any geocoding.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>Revisit the geocoding section discussing geocoding errors. Examine the OISs that have not been geocoded to specific locations. Fix their addresses and redo the geocoding of these OISs to improve the accuracy of the data.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify officer-involved shootings that resulted in the offender being transported to the Hospital at the University of Pennsylvania. Create a map marking the location of HUP, the location of officer-involved shootings resulting in the offender being transported to HUP, and the locations of all other shootings.</p></li>
<li><p>For each shooting determine which hospital treated the offender. Use <code>st_distance()</code> to determine what percentage of those shot in an OIS went to the closest hospital.</p></li>
