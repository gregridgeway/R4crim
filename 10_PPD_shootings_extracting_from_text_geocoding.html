<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>In this section, we are going to explore officer-involved shootings (OIS) in Philadelphia. The Philadelphia Police Department posts a lot of information about officer-involved shootings online going back to 2007. Have a look at their <a href="https://www.phillypolice.com/ois/">OIS webpage</a>. While a lot of information has been posted to the webpage, more information is buried in text and pdf files linked to each of the incidents. In order for us to explore these data, we are going to scrape the basic information from the webpage, have R dig into the text and pdf files for dates, clean up addresses using regular expressions, geocode the addresses to latitude/longitude with the ArcGIS geocoder (using JSON), and then make maps describing the shootings.</p>
<p>Start by loading the packages we’ll need.</p>

<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Scraping the OIS data</h1>
<p>Let’s start by grabbing the raw HTML from the PPD OIS webpage. The website dynamically generates the tables. If we use <code>scan()</code> to pull all the HTML, it will just pull in the HTML code that instructs the web browser to pull in the data to build the tables. That is, the actual data will not be there, but HTML code for the browser to build the tables. To work around this, simply navigate your web browser to <a href="https://www.phillypolice.com/ois/">https://www.phillypolice.com/ois/</a>. Right-click on the page and select “Save As” and save the HTML page to a convenient data folder on your computer (Save or Save As on some browsers might be elsewhere, like under a File menu). Now that we have let the browser pull all the data to create the tables, we can use <code>scan()</code> to read in the file.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>a <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">scan</span>(<span class="at">file=</span><span class="st">"10_shapefiles_and_data/Officer Involved Shootings _ Philadelphia Police Department.html"</span>,</span>

</div>
<p><code>scan()</code> is a very simple function that just pulls in text from a file or URL. It does not attempt to do any formatting. <code>what=""</code> tells <code>scan()</code> to treat what it is reading in as text and <code>sep="\n"</code> tells <code>scan()</code> to break the text apart whenever it encounters a line feed character.</p>
<p>The first several elements of <code>a</code> are just HTML code setting up the page.</p>

<p>I noticed that for each table row related to an OIS there was some HTML code like <code>x-text="o.title"</code>. The same row includes a URL linking to another page with more detailed information. The third line of HTML code contains the address where the shooting occurred. There are additional table cells indicating injuries and how the shooting was adjudicated, but we will not work with these in this exercise.</p>

<p>We’ll use a similar strategy for all the shootings and all the data elements we wish to extract. Start by using <code>grep()</code> to find all of the lines of HTML code that start off a row for an OIS from 2013-2024. The data for OISs before 2013 look a little different and involve a little more customization. We’ll just focus on those after 2013. Let’s get the OIS ID, location, year, and the URL for the detailed information for each OIS. The exact date is not shown on the main page, but it is on the incident details page. We will fill in the date later. For now, we will set <code>date=NA</code> for all of the OISs.</p>

<p>Now let’s dig into the details of the incident, starting with the first OIS. The hyperlink in the very first OIS incident points to the page <a href="https://ois.sites.phillypolice.com/ps24-22/">https://ois.sites.phillypolice.com/ps24-22/</a>. Let’s read in the text from that page. If you study the HTML code for this page you will see that the detailed description of the incident begins after the line with the word “clearfix” and ends the line before the one with “.entry-content”. We can use <code>grep()</code> to find the line numbers for these two lines and then extract the text between them. We will also use <code>gsub()</code> to remove the HTML tags.</p>

6100 block of West Columbia Avenue
A Philadelphia police officer shot and killed a charging pit bull dog on June 24, 2024 in West Philadelphia.
The officer and his partner were on patrol around 1:43 p.m. when they responded to a radio call for a vicious dog on the 6100 block of West Colombia Avenue.
When officers arrived at the location, an individual flagged down the officers and pointed them toward the aggressive animal. As one officer approached the sidewalk, a black Pit Bull charged at him and the officer discharged his service weapon multiple times, striking the dog. The animal fled to the rear of a property and was later found deceased.
A search for the dog&amp;#8217;s owner is ongoing.
The discharging officer is 39 years old, a six-year veteran of the Philadelphia Police Department, and is assigned to the 19th Police District. He has been placed on administrative duty pending the outcome of the Internal Affairs and Officer-Involved Shooting Investigations.</code></pre>

<p>Reading the details here you learn that the date of the incident was June 24, 2024 and you learn that it was shooting of a pit bull that charged at an officer. We will extract the date from this text later.</p>
<p>Let’s also remove spaces, tabs, line feeds at the beginning and end of the text. I’m going to test out my regular expression on some sample text first. I’ve loaded this text with tabs, spaces, carriage returns, and line feeds at the beginning and end.</p>

<p>Many look good. Some have <code>NA</code>. And some say “Download the pdf file”. If you visit one of those pages associated with an <code>NA</code> you will see that they are essentially blank. For example, visit the page <a href="https://ois.sites.phillypolice.com/20-09/">https://ois.sites.phillypolice.com/20-09/</a> and you will see that the page is essentially blank. But there is another source in pdf format. Have a look at (https://www.phillypolice.com/assets/crime-maps-stats/officer-involved-shootings/20-09.pdf)[https://www.phillypolice.com/assets/crime-maps-stats/officer-involved-shootings/20-09.pdf]. This pdf file has the incident description. We just need to take the base of the URL, “https://www.phillypolice.com/assets/crime-maps-stats/officer-involved-shootings/” and use <code>paste0()</code> to tack on the incident id and a “.pdf” to get the URL for the pdf file. Similarly, if you try to visit one of the detail pages for an incident with “Download the pdf file” you will see that the page has some broken display of the file, but a live link to a pdf document. Inside those pdf documents are the detailed descriptions that we are looking for.</p>
<p>So let’s test this out.</p>

<pre><code>[1] 64
On Friday, March 13, 2020, at 5:51AM, Homicide Detectives assigned to the U.S. Marshals
Fugitive Task Force, SWAT Officers, and uniformed 15th District Police Officers went to a
property in the 1600 block of Bridge Street to execute a murder Arrest Warrant for Male #1.


After knocking and announcing themselves, with no response, SWAT officers breached the door
and went in. While heading upstairs to the second floor, they began taking gunfire from the
second floor, middle bedroom. The shooters were concealed behind the closed door. While
about three steps from the second floor, Officer #3 (in the third position heading upstairs), was
struck in the left shoulder and forearm. Simultaneously, the Officers #1 and #2 (in positions 1
and 2) continued up the stairs. Officer #2 discharged multiple times, striking the middle bedroom
door. When ordered to come out, occupants of the middle room complied and surrendered. The
wounded Officer was removed from the property and rushed him to Temple University Hospital.
He did not survive.


During the exchange of gunfire, one male was struck in the left hand and upper torso. Another
male at the property, was struck in the right leg. Both were transported to hospitals for treatment.


No further injuries were reported in connection with this incident.
Ten (10) firearms, were recovered from the middle bedroom.




*** Information posted in the original summary reflects a preliminary understanding of what
occurred at the time of the incident. This information is posted shortly after the incident and may
be updated as the investigation leads to new information. The District Attorney’s Office is
provided all the information from the PPD’s investigation prior to their charging decision.</code></pre>

<p>Here we used the function <code>pdf_text()</code> from the <code>pdftools</code> package to read in the text from the pdf file. For some reason, incident 15-35 has a particularly odd URL that we can fix now.</p>

<p>We now have the date for 144 of the incidents. The rest of the dates have formats that are in some variation of 01/11/2024 or 01-11-2024 or 01/11/24 or 01-11-24, sometimes with / separators and sometimes with - separators and sometimes with a four digit year and sometimes with a two digit year.

1 ﻿OIS# 17-13 \nOn Friday, May 12, 2017, at approximately 2:42 AM, 12th District uniformed officers responded to a radio call for a male violating a Protection From Abuse (PFA) order inside a residence on the 1200 block of south 51 street. The offender was inside the 2nd floor front bedroom. A female complainant stated the male might be armed with a knife.  The male refused officers’ direction to open the door and come out of the room. Officer number one forced the door open, and the offender, armed with a ten-inch knife, moved towards the officers. Officer number two deployed his ECW (Taser), contacting the offender, momentarily causing him to fall onto the bed. The offender stood up and while still holding the knife, moved towards the officers.  Officer number one discharged his service weapon, striking the offender in the torso. The offender was transported to Penn Presbyterian Medical Center where he was pronounced deceased.\nThere were no other injuries as a result of this incident.  A knife was recovered at the scene.\n*** Information posted in the original summary reflects a preliminary understanding of what occurred at the time of the incident. This information is posted shortly after the incident and may be updated as the investigation leads to new information. The DA’s Office is provided all the information from the PPD’s investigation prior to their charging decision.</code></pre>

<h1 data-number="4"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Geocoding the OIS locations</h1>
<p>Our OIS data frame has the address for every incident, but to be more useful we really need the geographical coordinates. If we had the coordinates, then we could put them on a map, tabulate how many incident occur within an area, calculate distances, and answer geographical questions about these data.</p>
<p>Geocoding is the process of converting a text description of a location (typically and address or intersection) to obtain geographic coordinates (often longitude/latitude, but other coordinate systems are also possible). Google Maps currently reigns supreme in this area. Google Maps understand very general descriptions of locations. You can ask for the coordinates of something like “chipotle near UPenn” and it will understand that “UPenn” means the University of Pennsylvania and that “chipotle” is the burrito chain. Unfortunately, as of June 2018 Google Maps now requires a credit card in order to access its geocoding service. Previously, anyone could geocode up to 2,500 locations per day without needing to register.</p>
<p>We will use the the ArcGIS geocoder to get the coordinates of every location. Many web data sources use a standardized language for providing data. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is quite common and ArcGIS uses JSON.</p>
<p>The URL for ArcGIS has the form <code>https://geocode.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/World/GeocodeServer/findAddressCandidates?f=json&amp;singleLine=38th%20and%20Walnut,%20Philadelphia,%20PA&amp;outFields=Match_addr,Addr_type</code></p>
<p>You can see the address for Penn’s McNeil Building embedded in this URL. Spaces need to be replaced with <code>%20</code> (the space character has ASCII code 20). Let’s see what data we get back from this URL.</p>

<p>It is messy, but readable. You can see embedded in this text the <code>lat</code> and <code>lon</code> for this address. You can also see that it should not be too hard for a machine to extract these coordinates, and the rest of the information here, from this block of text. This is the point of JSON, producing data in a format that a human could understand in a small batch, but a machine could process fast and easily.</p>
<p>The <code>jsonlite</code> R package facilitates the conversion of JSON text like this into convenient R objects.</p>

<p><code>fromJSON()</code> converts the JSON results from the ArcGIS geocoder to an R <code>list</code> object. The JSON tags turn into list names and columns in a data frame.</p>
<p>To make geocoding a little more convenient, here is an R function that automates the process of taking an address, filling in <code>%20</code> for spaces in the appropriate URL, and retrieving the JSON results from the ArcGIS geocoding service.</p>

<p>Let’s test out <code>geocodeARCGIS()</code> by pulling up a up a map of the geocoded coordinates. Once we have the latitude and longitude for the McNeil Building, where we typically hold our crime data science courses at Penn, we can use <code>leaflet()</code> to show us a map of the area.</p>

<p>ArcGIS geocoding result for 3718 Locust Walk</p>

</div>
<p><code>leaflet()</code> prepares the mapping process. <code>addTiles()</code> pulls in the relevant map image (buildings and streets). <code>setView()</code> takes the longitude and latitude from our <code>gcPenn</code> object, sets that as the center of the map, and zooms in to level “18,” which is a fairly close zoom of about one block. <code>addCircleMarkers()</code> creates a circle at the selected point.</p>
<p>We are almost ready to throw all of our addresses at the geocoder, but let’s first make sure the addresses look okay. Several locations have <code>&amp;amp;</code>, the HTML code for an ampersand. We can clean this up with <code>gsub()</code>, replacing <code>&amp;amp;</code> with <code>and</code>. Also note that there’s a location with a lot of backslashes and quotes. We’ll clean that one up too.</p>

<p>I want these to get geocoded to the middle of the block. So I’m going to change addresses like these to be like “6150 block of West Columbia Avenue”, switching the number from 6100 to 6150 and deleting the “block of”. Note that the regular expressions here account for some of the variability in capitalization and the presence of the work “of”. (ArcGIS has become better at geocoding addresses like these and will geocode them to the midpoint of the block.)</p>

1 ﻿PS#16-18\n5/31/16\nOn Tuesday, May 31, 2016, at approximately 1:12 PM, an off-duty officer, in civilian attire, arrived home at his residence. Upon entering the front door, the officer observed the living room television missing, the rear kitchen window open, and the rear kitchen door ajar.  The officer heard voices coming from the basement.  The officer went to the top of the basement steps and announced, “Police.”  A male appeared at the bottom of the steps and charged up the steps toward the officer with a dark metal object in his hand.  In response, the officer discharged his weapon one time missing the offender.  The offender fell down the steps crashing into the basement wall.  The offender along with a second offender that was also in the basement fled out the rear basement door with the officer in foot pursuit.  Upon exiting the rear basement door, the officer observed a green/blue van pull away from his property.  The officer apprehended one offender in the 3200 block of Wellington Street.  An off-duty detective apprehended the other offender near Brighton and Hawthorne Streets.\nThere were no reported injuries as a result of this police firearm discharge.\nNo weapon was recovered.\n*** Information posted in the original summary reflects a preliminary understanding of what occurred at the time of the incident. This information is posted shortly after the incident and may be updated as the investigation leads to new information. The DA’s Office is provided all the information from the PPD’s investigation prior to their charging decision.

1 ﻿OIS# 17-08  (March 29, 2017)\nOn Wednesday, March 29, 2017, at approximately 5:39 PM, two uniformed officers in a marked vehicle responded to a radio assignment of “Person with a gun” at 5600 Whitby Avenue.  A description of the individual was broadcast.  Upon arrival at the location both officers observed a male who met the description entering the driver’s seat of a parked minivan.  As the male approached the open driver’s door area both officers instructed him to stop.  The male instead sat in the driver seat.  The male accelerated the vehicle rearward striking officer number one, knocking him to the ground.  The officer got back on his feet observed the male driver reach under the driver’s seat (through the open drivers side door), and officer number one discharged one round at the male.  The male drove from the location, struck a vehicle at 5700 Woodland Avenue, and continued toward Island Avenue and Lindbergh Boulevard where the minivan became disabled.  The male exited the minivan, entered an unoccupied vehicle that was nearby with the engine running and the keys in the ignition.  He ushered five passengers from the minivan into the stolen vehicle. The male drove the stolen vehicle to a house in New Castle Delaware, and dropped off four of the passengers. The male and a remaining female passenger drove to a second house in New Castle Delaware in the stolen vehicle.  New Castle County Police Officers responded to the second location and report to Philadelphia Police that New Castle County Police Officers attempted to arrest the male who was inside the stolen vehicle.  A uniformed New Castle County officer discharged his firearm multiple times, striking the male. The male was pronounced deceased at Christiana Hospital.\nThere were no other injuries as a result of this incident.  No firearm was recovered from the male or the vehicles.  The female was not charged with any offense.\n*** Information posted in the original summary reflects a preliminary understanding of what occurred at the time of the incident. This information is posted shortly after the incident and may be updated as the investigation leads to new information. The DA’s Office is provided all the information from the PPD’s investigation prior to their charging decision.

<p>Reading the details of the incidents, we can come up with reasonable fixes to the addresses. OIS 17-08 is not a PPD shoting incident. Some PPD officers were present when New Castle County (Delaware) police officers shot someone. Let’s drop this incident. The remaining incidents we can edit based on the contents of the OIS description. We’ll also tack on “, Philadelphia, PA” to the end of each location to improve geocoding accuracy.</p>

<p>Let’s test out the process for just the first location. The code here shows how you can extract each bit of information that we want from geocoding an address: the coordinates (long,lat), the specific address that the geocoding service translated our requested address to, a quality-of-match score, and location type (e.g.&nbsp;StreetInt, PointAddress, StreetAddress).</p>

<p>With that we are ready to run all of our addresses through the ArcGIS geocoder. We could have geocoded all these addresses with the more simple code <code>lapply(ois$location, geocodeARCGIS)</code>. However, if the JSON connection to the geocoder fails for even one of the addresses (likely if you have a poor internet connection), then the whole <code>lapply()</code> function fails. With the for-loop implementation, if the connection fails, then <code>ois</code> still keeps all of the prior geocoding results and you can restart the for-loop at the point where it failed.</p>

<p>All the points have latitude around 39 and 40 and longitude around -75. That’s a good sign!</p>
<p>Let’s check the “address type”. We should worry about addresses geocode to a “StreetName.” That means the incident got geocoded to, say, “Market Street” but we are not sure where along Market Street the incident actually occurred. The geocoder most likely placed the incident at the midpoint of the street.</p>

1 4100 block of Parkside Avenue \nOn 10-4-2021, at approximately 1:29 a.m., 16th District Officers (Officer #1, Officer #2, Officer #3, and Officer #4), in full uniform and operating marked patrol vehicles, responded to the 4100 block of Parkside Avenue for multiple calls for gunshots. While surveying the area for the gunshots, the officers heard the gunfire. In addition, civilians directed the officers in the direction of where they believed the gunshots emanated from. While in the rear of a schoolyard at 3800 Lansdowne Drive, Officers observed the offender, 55/B/M, discharging a rifle. The officers ordered the offender to “drop the gun” several times; however, the offender ignored their verbal commands and discharged his rifle towards police. In response, the officers discharged their weapons, striking the offender in his right and left collarbone area. During the exchange of gunfire, Officer #1 sustained a GSW to his right arm. Officer #2 sustained a graze wound to the nose area.\nNote: The offender was wearing a bulletproof vest at the time of his arrest.\nAn AR style rifle, .40 caliber handgun, multiple magazines, and multiple FCCs were recovered at the scene.\nIt is believed that the male was also involved at a homicide at Jefferson Hospital, just prior to the police involved shooting.\nBoth the Homicide Unit and the OISI Unit coordinated their investigations.

<p>For one incident the location was “3800 Landsowne Drive”. Presumably it intended to find 3800 Lansdowne Drive, but it could not place the 3800 block on Lansdowne Drive. The description describes the incident as occurring behind a school. Let’s zoom in and see where this might have occurred. It must have occurred behind the School of the Future.</p>

<h1 data-number="5"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Working with shapefiles and coordinate systems</h1>
<p>The Philadelphia Police Department divides the city into Police Service Areas (PSAs). The city provides a <em>shapefile</em>, a file containing geographic data, that describes the boundaries of the PSAs at Philadelphia’s <a href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/police-service-areas">open data site</a>. R can read these files using the <code>st_read()</code> function provided in the <code>sf</code> (simple features) package. Even though <code>st_read()</code> appears to only be accessing <code>Boundaries_PSA.shp</code>, you should have all of the <code>Boundaries_PSA</code> files in your <code>10_shapefiles_and_data</code> folder. The other files have information that <code>st_read()</code> needs, like the coordinate system stored in <code>Boundaries_PSA.prj</code>. If you do not have all <code>Boundaries_PSA</code> files in your folder, then in a few lines you will get errors like “the sfc object should have crs set,” meaning that the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) is missing.</p>

<p>The first column shows the PSA number and the second column shows a truncated description of the geometry associated with this row. In this case, <code>geometry</code> contains the coordinates of the boundary of the PSA for each row. Use <code>st_geometry()</code> to extract the polygons to make a plot.</p>

<p>The coordinate system used to describe the PPD boundaries is the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) maintained by the United States National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, one of several standards to aid in navigation and geography. The European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG) maintains a catalog of different coordinate systems (should be no surprise that oil exploration has driven the development of high quality geolocation standards). They have assigned the standard longitude/latitude coordinate system to be [EPSG4326]((http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4326/). You can find the full collection of coordinate systems at <a href="http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/">spatialreference.org</a>. You can see in the output above a reference to EPSG 4326.</p>
<p>Many of us are comfortable with the longitude/latitude angular coordinate systems. However, the distance covered by a degree of longitude shrinks as you move towards the poles and only equals the distance covered by a degree of latitude at the equator. In addition, the earth is not very spherical so the coordinate system used for computing distances on the earth surface might need to depend on where you are on the earth surface.</p>
<p>Almost all web mapping tools (Google Maps, ESRI, OpenStreetMaps) use the pseudo-Mercator projection (<a href="http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/3857/">EPSG3857</a>). Let’s convert our PPD map to that coordinate system.</p>

This particular projection of the <code>PPDmap</code> is tuned to provide good precision for the southern part of Pennsylvania (note the parallel coordinates are at the latitude of southern Pennsylvania and the meridian is a little west of Philadelphia) and distances are measured in feet (note the <code>LENGTHUNIT["US survey foot",0.304800609601219]</code> tag in the CRS description).</p>
<p>Let’s transform back to longitude/latitude. It really is best to work using a different coordinate system, but I’m going to stick with longitude/latitude so that the values make a little more sense to us.</p>

<p>To make the dots a little transparent, I’ve used the <code>rgb()</code> function with which you can mix red, green, and blue colors and set the transparency. The <code>1</code> tells <code>rgb()</code> to use maximum red. The two <code>0</code>s tell <code>rgb()</code> to use no green or blue. The 0.5 tells <code>rgb()</code> to make the dots halfway transparent.</p>

<h1 data-number="6"><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Spatial joins</h1>
<p>Spatial joins is the process of linking two data sources by their geography. For the case of the OIS data, we want to know how many OISs occurred in each PSA. To do this we need to drop each OIS point location into the PSA polygons and have R tell us in which polygon did each OIS land.</p>
<p>First we need to convert our <code>ois</code> data frame to an <code>sf</code> object, communicating to R that the <code>lon</code> and <code>lat</code> columns are special. At this stage we also have to communicate in what coordinate system are the <code>lon</code> and <code>lat</code> values. <code>st_as_sf()</code> converts an R object into an <code>sf</code> object.</p>

1 ﻿PS#16-30\n9/16/16\nOn Friday, September 16, 2016, at approximately 11:18 P.M., a uniformed sergeant in a marked police vehicle was seated in her parked vehicle in the 5100 block of Sansom Street, when a male approached and without warning, began to discharge a firearm, striking the sergeant, as she remained seated in her vehicle. The offender then began walking east on Sansom Street, stopping at a lounge/bar in the 5100 block of Sansom Street, where he discharged his firearm into the lounge/bar, striking a female employee and a male security guard. The offender continued walking east on Sansom Street to the 4900 block, where he discharged his firearm into an occupied parked vehicle, striking one female and one male occupant.\nResponding uniformed officers, in marked police vehicles, along with an officer from the University of Pennsylvania police force, located the offender in an alleyway in the rear of the 4800 blocks of Sansom and Walnut Streets. While in the 4800 block of Sansom Street the offender discharged his firearm, striking the University of Pennsylvania Officer as well as a marked police vehicle. Four Officers (one of whom was the University of Pennsylvania Officer) discharged their firearms, striking the offender.  The offender fell to the ground and dropped his firearm.  Fire Rescue responded and pronounced the offender deceased. \nThe offender’s firearm, a 9MM, semi-automatic pistol, with an obliterated serial number, loaded with 14 live rounds, was recovered at the scene. There were three empty magazines from the offender’s firearm recovered throughout the scene.  \nThe sergeant, the University of Pennsylvania Officer, along with the four civilians who were all struck by gunfire, were transported to Penn-Presbyterian Hospital for treatment.\nThe female from the parked vehicle was later pronounced deceased at Penn-Presbyterian Hospital.\n*** Information posted in the original summary reflects a preliminary understanding of what occurred at the time of the incident. This information is posted shortly after the incident and may be updated as the investigation leads to new information. The DA’s Office is provided all the information from the PPD’s investigation prior to their charging decision.</code></pre>

<p>These are eight digit codes describing the color. The first two digits correspond to red, digits three and four correspond to green, digits five and six correspond to blue, and the last two digits correspond to transparency. These are hexadecimal numbers (base 16). Hexadecimal numbers use the digits 0-9, like normal decimal system numbers, and then denote 10 as A, 11 as B, on up to 15 as F. So FF as a decimal is <span class="math inline">\(15 \times 16 + 15 = 255\)</span>, which is the maximum value for a two digit hexadecimal. The hexadecimal 80 as a decimal is <span class="math inline">\(8 \times 16 + 0 = 128\)</span>, which is in the middle of the range 0 to 255. So the first color code, FFFF80FF, means maximum red, maximum green, half blue, and not transparent at all. This mixture is known more commonly as “yellow”.</p>
<p>Now we join <code>PPDmap</code> with our color lookup table in <code>a</code> and plot it.</p>

<h1 data-number="7"><span class="header-section-number">7</span> Summary</h1>
<p>We started with just a web page linking to a collection of pdf files. We used regular expressions to extract everything we could from the web page tables. We had R “read” the pdf files to extract the dates that were not readily available. We geocoded the stops so that we could put them on a map. Finally, we could tabulate by PSA the number of OISs and map those as well.</p>
<p>If you’ve worked through all of this, then I would recommend that you save your objects, using <code>save(ois, PSAlookup, gcOIS, file="PPDOIS.RData")</code>. That way you will not have to scrape everything off the web again or redo any geocoding.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>Revisit the geocoding section discussing geocoding errors. Examine the OISs that have not been geocoded to specific locations. Fix their addresses and redo the geocoding of these OISs to improve the accuracy of the data.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify officer-involved shootings that resulted in the offender being transported to the Hospital at the University of Pennsylvania. Create a map marking the location of HUP, the location of officer-involved shootings resulting in the offender being transported to HUP, and the locations of all other shootings.</p></li>
<li><p>For each shooting determine which hospital treated the offender. Use <code>st_distance()</code> to determine what percentage of those shot in an OIS went to the closest hospital.</p></li>
